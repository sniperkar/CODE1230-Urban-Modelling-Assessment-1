    <h2>The long-term plan is led by the mayor of Madrid, who has built more than 43km of infrastructure, including six projects along the Banks of the manzanares river, to put the M30 beltway into an underground tunnel during his tenure.West8 and MRIO, a local firm, jointly designed the urban renewal master plan for the riparian rehabilitation area.International bids for the project were announced in 2005.The plan of west8 and MRIO to build the restored area above the tunnel is the only solution to the city's problems through a landscape approach. The design is based on the concept of "3+30",proposed to divide the 80  hectare urban development area into three strategic startup projects.The basic structure formed after the completion of these three projects can lay a foundation for future large quantum projects.The implementation of the sub-projects will be mainly undertaken by the government, but private investors and residents are not excluded.But so far, there have been 47 parallel projects with a total budget of 280 million euros, of which important ones include:Salon de Pinos,Avenida de Portugal,Huerta de la Partida,Parque de la Arganzuela,Puentes Cascara.</h2>

    <h3>Madrid Rio city park won the 53rd edition of the FAD awards for cities and landscapes.The jury agreed that the park best represents urban development. Its design scheme is coherent and meticulous, and its construction is precise and meticulous, making the city more vivid. Madrid Rio city park, which covers 120 hectares, is a public green space in central Madrid next to the manzanares river. By remodeling previous high roads underground, redeveloping riverbanks and urban Spaces, the designers have turned the park into a local oasis for leisure.

The bad part is the lack of parking.</h3>
