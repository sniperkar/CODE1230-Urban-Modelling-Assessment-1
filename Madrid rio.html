    <h3>Madrid Rio city park won the 53rd edition of the FAD awards for cities and landscapes.The jury agreed that the park best represents urban development. Its design scheme is coherent and meticulous, and its construction is precise and meticulous, making the city more vivid. Madrid Rio city park, which covers 120 hectares, is a public green space in central Madrid next to the manzanares river. By remodeling previous high roads underground, redeveloping riverbanks and urban Spaces, the designers have turned the park into a local oasis for leisure.

The bad part is the lack of parking.</h3><h3>Keymoves：The city undertook infrastructure measures over a total length of 43 kilometres, six of them along the banks of the River Manzanares, at a total cost of six billion Euro.A total of 47 subprojects with a combined total budget of 280 million Euros have since been developed, the most important of which include: the Salón de Pinos, Avenida de Portugal, Huerta de la Partida, Jardines de Puente de Segovia, Jardines de Puente de Toledo, Jardines de la Virgen del Puerto and the Parque de la Arganzuela.</h3>
