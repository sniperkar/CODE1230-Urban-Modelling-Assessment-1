  <h1>Urban transformation </h1>
  <p>Sydney Newcastle East End</p>
  <h2>Define ：Urban transformation refers to significant changes and turns in various fields and aspects, including transportation, education, in order to better develop the city in line with the society. From the original economic mode to a new economic mode that is more suitable and beneficial to the majority of the people</h2>

  <h3>Newcastle East End, once a port city which depend on steel and coal, is changing its mode.It brings together huge transportation investments, the revitalization of the city's waterfront, the revitalized central business district, universities and the new south wales state government's $6.5 billion investment to make it a new thriving city.


For the past few years, Newcastle university has been investing heavily in education and expanding its wings and dollars.
First this 2017 will be the official opening of the $95 million new space campus, bringing students into the city, further boosting and benefiting from investment in CBD.

And it has introduced new light rail projects, Newcastle's new public transport system that will link buses, ferries and light rail timetables, which is expected to add $2.5 billion to the local economy.
    
In addition to heavy investment and education growth, Newcastle is also making full use of its tourism potential - bringing more jobs and money to the region - and this will continue as cruising becomes more popular. By the end of 2018, we have increased dockside earnings through Carrington a new $13 million cruise terminal, which Newcastle can collect up to $11 million a year from cruise Tours, which will increase the amount of coal trade at Newcastle port.
These changes have made the city, once an industrial powerhouse, one of the most important cultural, commercial and heritage centers in new south wales.</h3>

  <h4>Newcastle, the second largest city in new south wales, is undergoing changes, from its train line being truncated to favour light rail, to new multi-storey buildings rising into the sky around the CBD.
The east side of Newcastle represents part of the master plan for Newcastle city centre along hunter street. Building 1 is at the western end of the master plan, bordered by Perkins and Wolfe streets, and contains four residential buildings on retail grounds. Develop new site links and open public Spaces through the excellent design process. </h4>

    <h5>The challenging project involves three architects (SJB, Tonkin Zulaikha Greer and Durbach Block Jaggers) and several heritage projects, including the listed Scott building, which only recently housed David Jones in the Hunter Street Mall retail district.
There are several stories of construction in Newcastle's existing buildings. There is a strong precedent for using durable materials, especially masonry structures, and many examples of using colors that provide a bit of variation and reinforce Newcastle's character and coastal location. 
      All the new buildings are designed to celebrate and contribute to the unique character of the town center.
Since the new light rail project was updated, the population of Newcastle has increased by 4.6% and jobs by 9%, and construction of the new track will boost other infrastructure projects.While the light rail is being constructed in Newcastle, many upper levels CBD have been constructed.These constructions have enriched People's Daily life. People can go shopping in CBD, shopping, and have recreational activities. More importantly, they have accelerated the growth of Australian economy and increased the GDP.

With a total length of only 3 kilometers, the Newcastle light rail, at a cost of up to 300 million Australian dollars, is not working.Economists warn that these huge infrastructure projects could lead to huge fiscal waste. A leaked new south wales government report suggests the light rail line may not be able to recoup construction costs.Some reports show that the newly built light rail coverage area is in the shape of a long corridor on the map, which does not have the inherent conditions for large-scale commercial development, not to mention the fact that there is still a certain degree of soil pollution in the area, which will cost a huge amount of money to deal with.</h5>

  <h1>KEYMOVE</h1>
     <h6>The Light rail shortens train lines,beacuse Newcastle which a traditional area of heavy industry, is not immune to the recession that has plagued new south wales and wider Australia since the 1970s. These recessions are particularly severe for heavy industry, which is particularly prevalent in Newcastle. The recession of the early 1990s led to a sharp drop in the overall Australian unemployment rate, which reached 17 per cent in Newcastle in February 1993, compared with 12.1 per cent in new south wales and 11.9 per cent in Australia.

          oppose：While the project has been hugely profitable,Newcastle east residents undoubtedly see themselves as guardians of their suburban heritage. They know that once a region's history is lost, it can be difficult to recover it.They worry that reshaping the roads will affect the region's traditional sense.</h8>
